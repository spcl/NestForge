"""Read-only structure inspection for the agent (and the deterministic path).

Two views, both non-mutating -- safe to call at any point in a session:
  * :func:`describe_graph` -- the SDFG as an ASCII TREE: nested regions/loops/conditionals, each State,
    each map-nest with its normalized iteration domain and read/write arrays.
  * :func:`nest_reads_writes` -- the arrays a single nest reads and writes, without extracting it.

The tree is the agent's whole view of the program, so it is projected from the normal form
(:mod:`nestforge.normalize`): every line names a block or kernel by its canonical
``<kind><level>_<index>`` label, and every loop and map shows a ``0:trip:1`` domain. Pass ``handle``
to also stamp each actionable line with a session id, so READING the tree and ACTING on it use one
vocabulary rather than two views the agent has to join by eyeballing labels.

Every line carries what the agent needs to act on that line and nothing else. Facts that hold for a
whole KIND of line -- that map fusion never crosses a State, that a conditional's selector stays in the
core SDFG -- belong in the phase skills, not repeated on every row of a hundred-kernel tree.

A condition is shown in terms of the ARRAYS it really reads. The frontend hoists a scalar read out to
an interstate assignment (``A_index = A[1 + i]``) and the branch then tests a name that means nothing
on its own, so :func:`resolve_scalars` folds those definitions back in until only arrays,
non-transients and free symbols are left.
