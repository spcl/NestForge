"""Normalize an SDFG into the form the agent's text tree is projected from.

The tree (:mod:`nestforge.introspect`) is the agent's whole view of the program, so every name it
prints has to be an identifier the agent can hand back, and every construct has to render one way
regardless of which frontend (Fortran, numpy, C, C++) produced it. Four properties give that, and
:func:`normalize_for_tree` establishes them in this order:

1. **No top-level nested SDFG.** A ``NestedSDFG`` outside every map scope is an opaque box in the
   middle of the tree: its states are real control flow the agent cannot see or fuse across. Widening
   its boundary memlets (``ExpandNestedSDFGInputs``) then inlining it (``InlineMultistateSDFG``)
   lifts that control flow into the tree. A nested SDFG INSIDE a map is left alone -- it is the body
   of a kernel, not structure.
2. **Canonical iteration domains.** Every map range and loop counter becomes ``0:trip:1`` -- dace's
   ``NormalizeLoopsAndMaps``. Steps are then positive and unit by construction, so the tree never has
   to render a descending or strided domain and the emitters never have to reason about step sign.
3. **Every computation sits inside a map.** A ``Tasklet`` outside all map scopes is enclosed in a
   single-iteration map, so "one map is one kernel" holds with no exceptions for the tree, the
   granularity lattice, or offloading to special-case. A ``LibraryNode`` is deliberately NOT wrapped:
   it already denotes a kernel, and burying it under a map scope would hide that.
4. **Canonical labels.** Every control-flow block and every map is renamed ``<kind><level>_<index>``,
   globally unique, so two runs over the same input produce the same names and a tree line names
   something the agent can refer back to. Maps are ``kernel`` -- one map is one kernel, including the
   wrap maps step 3 just added. Transient DATA and map parameters are renamed here too -- ``t<n>``
   for arrays, ``s<n>`` for scalars, ``i<n>`` for parameters. The frontend qualifies a transient with
   its whole module path (``npbench_..._build_up_b___tmp1``), which was most of the width of a tree
   line and carried nothing the agent can use.

Steps 1-3 act on this SDFG and its control-flow regions only; a ``NestedSDFG`` that survives step 1
is a kernel body, and the agent fuses kernels, not their insides. Step 4 is the exception and
descends everywhere, because a nameless map is a hole in the vocabulary wherever it sits.
