"""Session: the consolidated agent-facing API over the 4-phase optimizer.

A stateless model cannot hold a live SDFG node across turns -- a reference goes stale the moment any
transformation mutates the graph, and a stale reference is a silently-wrong move, not an error. The
:class:`Session` closes that gap: the SDFG lives here (server-side), and the agent names graph objects
only by **epoch-stamped string ids**.

The contract:

  * A ``list_*`` call mints ids at the session's current epoch and returns plain data (labels, read/write
    sets, reasons) -- never a node.
  * A mutating call (:meth:`fuse`, :meth:`fission_all`, :meth:`fission_map`, :meth:`externalize`) bumps the
    epoch and clears every handle, then returns the fresh graph. The tree it returns carries ids again --
    minted at the NEW epoch by :meth:`describe` -- so the agent can act on what it was just handed
    without a re-list; it is only the ids it held from BEFORE the call that are now stale.
  * An id from a past epoch no longer resolves: :meth:`resolve` raises :class:`StaleHandle` telling the
    agent to re-list. That is the safety net -- the "enumerate -> apply one -> re-enumerate" discipline the
    arms require, enforced by the id scheme instead of by the agent remembering to do it.

Every method is one agent tool; every return value is JSON-serializable, so a transport layer (MCP, RPC)
is a thin wrapper over this class and holds no graph state of its own. The same calls drive the
deterministic path -- a strategy is just a scripted policy over ``list_fusions`` / ``fuse``.
