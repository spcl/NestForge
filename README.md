# NestForge

NestForge optimizes whole DaCe programs for CPU and GPU. It takes an SDFG from the Python or Fortran
frontend, turns its loop nests into standalone kernels, gives each kernel a device, a canonical parallel
form (CPF) implementation and a compiler configuration, and links the kernels back into one program.
Every kernel is checked against its NumPy oracle.

The work runs in six phases. Each phase makes one decision and ships a deterministic default. A scripted
optimizer, a human and an LLM agent drive the same `Session` API, so an agent can take over any phase
while the defaults run the rest.

[![NestForge phases](docs/figures/pipeline.png)](docs/figures/pipeline.svg)

| Phase | Decides | Default optimizer | Agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| [0 Normalize](docs/phases/0-normalize.md) | canonical parallel form for the enabled targets | canonicalize up to fusion | none |
| [1 Shape Kernels](docs/phases/1-shape-kernels.md) | fusion and fission granularity | fuse all legal loops | scheduling |
| [2 Define Scopes](docs/phases/2-define-scopes.md) | which nests become external kernels | one scope per parallel top-level map | scheduling |
| [3 Offload](docs/phases/3-offload.md) | device per kernel, host/device copies | all scopes on the GPU with a GPU target | scheduling |
| [4 Optimize Kernels](docs/phases/4-optimize-kernels.md) | each kernel's code, one `lib<kernel>.a` | standalone CPF kernel: C++ on CPU, CUDA on GPU | kernel |
| [5 Sweep Configurations](docs/phases/5-sweep-configurations.md) | compiler, FP mode, vectorizer cost model | keep the fastest correct variant | none |

Two analysis agents [request changes](docs/phases/feedback.md): one reads runtimes and sends phase 1
back to reshape kernels, the other reads placements and sends phase 2 back to redefine scopes. Agents
follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Quick start

```bash
python examples/quickstart.py --device cpu --out quickstart_out
python examples/quickstart.py --device gpu --out quickstart_out
```

The script runs the default optimizer on HPCAgent-Bench's `fuse_diamond` at preset S (`LEN_1D=512`):
four loops where `t = a*a` feeds `u = t + 1` and `v = t - 1`, then `out = u*v`. It prints the structure
tree before phase 0:

```
SDFG 'hpcagent_bench_benchmarks_loop_level_reasoning_fuse_diamond_fuse_diamond_dace_fuse_diamond'
|- for0_0  i=0:LEN_1D
|  `- state1_0
|- for0_1  i=0:LEN_1D
|  `- state1_1
|- for0_2  i=0:LEN_1D
|  `- state1_2
`- for0_3  i=0:LEN_1D
   `- state1_3
```

and after phase 0, in canonical parallel form:

```
SDFG 'hpcagent_bench_benchmarks_loop_level_reasoning_fuse_diamond_fuse_diamond_dace_fuse_diamond'
`- state0_0
   `- kernel1_0  [_loop_it_0=0:LEN_1D]  reads=['a'] writes=['out']
```

0. Normalize fuses the four sequential loops into one parallel map that reads `a` and writes `out`.
1. Shape Kernels finds nothing left to fuse.
2. Define Scopes turns the map into one kernel, `extcall_0`, and lists where its inputs come from:
   `extcall_0: a <- program, LEN_1D <- program`.
3. Offload keeps the kernel on the host for CPU; for GPU it runs on the device, with `a` copied in and
   `out` copied back.
4. Optimize Kernels renders `extcall_0` as one CPF C++ or CUDA file and builds `libextcall_0.a`.
5. Sweep Configurations times 15 CPU variants or 4 GPU variants (two nvcc toolkits, two FP modes) and
   keeps the fastest one that matches NumPy.

## Install and test

```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup_apt.sh                            # compilers, libomp, BLAS/LAPACK, binutils (Ubuntu)
pip install -e ".[dev]"                                   # dace @ extended, hpcagent-bench @ main
pre-commit install                                        # ruff check and ruff format on every commit
pytest -m "not integration and not gpu and not vendor"    # unit set, as CI runs it
pytest -m integration                                     # compiles and runs kernels
```

NestForge assumes Linux. Benchmark kernels and the NumPy to C, C++ and Fortran translator come from
[HPCAgent-Bench](https://github.com/spcl/HPCAgent-Bench). HPCAgent-Bench drives NestForge, so
`import nestforge` never loads HPCAgent-Bench; only the functions that need it do.
