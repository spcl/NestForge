# Kernel Dependencies

[Overview](../README.md) · related: [2 Define Scopes](phases/2-define-scopes.md), [3 Offload](phases/3-offload.md)

`kernel_dependencies(sdfg)` (`nestforge/ir/depends.py`) answers one question for every `ExternalCall`
argument: which producers can reach it. It reads the lowered SDFG and never changes it.

```
extcall_1: T <- extcall_0.T, N <- program
extcall_0: A <- extcall_1.A [carried: for_39] | program, N <- program
exit: A <- extcall_1.A | program
```

## Producers

- `program`: a non-transient container or free symbol not written before the read.
- `extcall_i.arg`: an `ExternalCall` output. The argument comes from the connector (`_out_<arg>`),
  not the data name, so phase 3's `A_gpu` renames do not show.
- `host:<state>`: any other writer (tasklet, nested SDFG, other library node).

A whole `AccessNode -> AccessNode` copy forwards its source's producers, so offload copies stay
invisible.

A `View` stands for the array it views, resolved through view chains to the root
(`get_view_edge`, `get_last_view_node`): a write into the view writes that array, a read reads it,
and the binding edge itself moves no data.

## Rules

- Whole containers only. A read reads all of it; a write replaces all of it.
- `if` without `else`: branch results plus the incoming reach. With `else`: branch results only.
- Loop: fixpoint. A reach that crossed the back edge is tagged `[carried: <loop>]`. After the loop
  the incoming reach stays unless `loop_provably_at_least_one_iteration` proves one trip.
- `break` joins the loop exit, `continue` joins the back edge, `return` joins the SDFG exit.
- Interstate `k = v`: `k` takes the producers of every name `v` reads, and `via` records the text.
- Kernel symbols come from the manifest (`input_args` minus `array_args`).
- Refused with `UnsupportedProgram`: `Reference` containers, a view that binds no container, an
  `ExternalCall` inside a nested SDFG, an `ExternalCall` without a manifest.

## Session

- `kernel_graph()`: the graph, computed once per epoch.
- `list_kernels()`: per kernel its id, device (after phase 3), inputs, outputs, symbols, `depends`
  (`arg -> producer labels`) and `carried` (`arg -> loop labels`).
- `describe(deps=True)`: each kernel's line under its row in the tree.
- `define_scopes()` and `offload()` write `<work_dir>/kernel_deps/e<epoch>.json`; nothing reads it back.
- `offload()` also returns `transfers` (`phases/offload.py`): every edge whose producer and consumer sit
  in different memory spaces, beside the `copies` phase 3 inserted.

## Output

`KernelGraph.lines()` prints one line per kernel in program order, then `exit:`. `to_json()` is
sorted and byte-stable across runs. `consumers_of(kernel)` lists the argument edges a kernel feeds.
