"""``run_isolated`` must survive a live OpenMP pool in the parent -- whichever runtime holds it.

``fork()`` duplicates only the calling thread. A child that enters a parallel region while the parent's
pool is live blocks forever on pool threads that no longer exist, and the failure has no symptom beyond
a wall-clock timeout: no crash, no compiler running, the parent simply sits in ``select()``.

libgomp deadlocks exactly this way and installs no ``pthread_atfork`` handler; LLVM's libomp installs
one and recovers. Since the OpenMP runtime is a configurable axis -- libgomp is a valid gnu-only choice
-- ``run_isolated`` must not be safe merely because the default runtime happens to be the forgiving one.
:func:`pause_openmp_pools` is what makes that true, so these tests poison the parent on purpose and
assert the child still runs.
