"""ONE OpenMP runtime, globally, across every compiler and every lane -- the PARALLEL.md contract.

Every node library and the driver must link the SAME OpenMP runtime, so that libraries built by
DIFFERENT compilers share one runtime and ONE thread pool. Left to a bare ``-fopenmp`` each family
links its own default (gcc -> libgomp, clang -> libomp, icx -> libiomp5), which silently puts TWO
runtimes with two thread pools in one process as soon as a sweep spans gcc and clang.

These tests assert on the ARTIFACT, not on the flag list: ``readelf -d`` over a real ``.so`` says which
runtime actually landed in DT_NEEDED. That distinction is the whole point -- the violation these tests
were written for was invisible to every flag-level assertion, because each family's flags looked
perfectly correct in isolation. Only linking a cell from each compiler and comparing the results shows
the two runtimes.

Most tests here only LINK -- linking is what selects a runtime, so compiling is the whole experiment,
and it keeps this process free of the libgomp fork hazard (an OpenMP region here would poison every
later ``run_isolated`` fork). The one end-to-end test that must RUN both nests does so in a fresh
interpreter via exec, for the same reason plus a second: a forked child inherits every mapping the
worker already had, so it could not tell which runtime the two node libraries themselves pulled in.
