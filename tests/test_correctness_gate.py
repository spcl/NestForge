"""The gate that decides whether a measured kernel counts as CORRECT.

Every arena cell, every differential swap and every E-driver row is admitted or rejected by
``arena.diff_stats`` and the tolerance ``arena.rung_atol`` hands it. A gate that is too tight silently
deletes a whole kernel class from the corpus; one that is too loose admits a miscompile and reports
it as a speed-up. Both failures are invisible in the tables they corrupt -- there is no red test, just
a number that is wrong -- so the properties are pinned here rather than inferred from the sweeps.

Each test names the failure it prevents. Two of them are regressions of bugs that shipped: a NaN that
was reported as a PERFECT match, and a verdict read off zero elements.
