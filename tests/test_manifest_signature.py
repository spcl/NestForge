"""The manifest's stated invariant: ``input_args`` IS the emitted numpy kernel's positional signature.

The two are consumed together (``translate.prepare`` / ``prepare_whole_program`` write the numpy source and
the manifest side by side), and the translator derives its C parameter list -- which names are array
pointers, which are scalars -- by walking ``input_args``. A name in the numpy signature but missing from
``input_args`` is therefore never declared, and the emitted C references an undeclared identifier.

Scratch transients are the case that breaks the tie: the C-style memory model makes every non-scalar
transient a caller-allocated parameter, so it sits in the numpy signature between the outputs and the size
symbols and must appear in the manifest at exactly that position.
