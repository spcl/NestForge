"""Phase-IV re-inlining: an externalized nest must come back FUSABLE.

The agent externalizes nests to measure them, then asks for two of them to be fused again. That round trip
only works if (a) the ``ExternalCall`` still carries the nest's own SDFG and (b) expanding it back leaves
maps the fusion arms can actually see. A NestedSDFG hides its maps from ``MapFusion``, so a re-inlined
program that is never inlined fuses nothing -- and reports success while doing it.
