"""The nest's non-transient arrays come from the kernel's OptArena manifest
(:func:`nestforge.tsvc.index_fills` + ``make_inputs(given=...)``), transients keep the random fill.

The case under test is the integer index array. The default uniform float fill cast to an integer dtype
collapses to ALL-ZEROS, which silently degrades a gather ``a[i] = b[ip[i]]`` into a single cached read of
``b[0]`` and inverts a scatter ``a[ip[i]] = ...`` from hpcagent_bench's guaranteed conflict-FREE permutation into
a maximal write conflict on ``a[0]``. Both are invisible to validation -- the oracle reads the same
degenerate ``ip`` -- so only an explicit test pins the property.
