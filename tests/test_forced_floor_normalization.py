"""Every nest-forge SDFG is normalized before anything measures it.

Python's `//` on a sympy expression is `sympy.floor(...)`, which sympy distributes and codegen then
prints WITHOUT the floor -- the index truncates term by term. Kernel source is safe (dace parses `//`
into int_floor); transformation code is not, so the pass is forced at both entry points.
