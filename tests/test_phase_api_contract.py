"""CI contract tests for the AGENT-FACING phase API -- the surface `skills/*/SKILL.md` teaches.

A skill file is a prompt: an agent reads it and copies the snippet verbatim. So a stale name there is
not a documentation nit, it is a runtime failure in the one consumer that cannot debug it. Two such
drifts already shipped -- `strategy_names()` lost half its entries after `offload.py` registered the
per-unit strategies into the same registry, and `nestforge.optimize` was shadowed by the re-exported
`optimize` FUNCTION, so `nestforge.optimize.optimization_choices` raised AttributeError on a function.

These tests scan the skill files rather than pinning one known name, because the bug class recurs.
