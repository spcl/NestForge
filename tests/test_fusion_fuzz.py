"""Fuzz the Phase-2 arms: RANDOM programs x RANDOM fuse/fission sequences, asserting the three properties
that make the arms safe for an agent to drive --

  1. no crash (enumeration and application never raise on a valid program),
  2. ``sdfg.validate()`` holds after every sequence,
  3. the result is bit-exact to the un-transformed reference.

Deterministic: every case is seeded, and a failure reports the seed AND the generated source so it can be
replayed and shrunk by hand. Bounded for a shared box: small sizes, few loops, capped case count, ``-n1``.

The generator emits real ``@dace.program`` source into a temp module (the DaCe frontend parses a function's
SOURCE, so an ``exec``-ed function would not work) over a statement grammar with the hazards that matter:
recurrences (sequential), element-wise (DOALL), stencil reads, and cross-array producer/consumer chains --
in sequential ``range`` loops and parallel ``dace.map`` loops.

    """A random but WELL-DEFINED ``@dace.program``: 2-4 loops, each with 1-2 statements from the grammar.
    Every loop runs ``1:N-1`` so ``i-1`` / ``i+1`` stay in bounds for any N >= 3.

    A ``dace.map`` is DATA PARALLEL by definition, so a map body must carry no cross-iteration dependence:
    inside a map we never offset-read (``x[i+-1]``) an array that any statement of that same map writes --
    that would be a race, making the program's own reference run order-dependent and the bit-exact
    comparison meaningless. Same-index reads (``src[i]``) are fine even for an array written in the map
    (an intra-iteration dependence the state's dataflow orders). Recurrences are sequential-only.

    The grammar also emits a LOOP-INVARIANT scalar ``s``: a sequential loop may write it (``s = a[i]``,
    last iteration wins) and any loop may read it. That shape is what a carried-offset dependence
    classifier sees no offset for -- there is no iterator in the subset to carry one -- and reading that
    as "no dependence" is a real fusion miscompile (a loop reading ``s`` unfused sees the FINAL value,
    fused it sees the RUNNING one). An earlier grammar without it fuzzed green over a live bug.

    One loop either READS ``s`` or WRITES it, never both, and only a sequential loop writes it. Writing
    ``s`` from a map is a race on the scalar -- every iteration stores to one cell. Reading and writing it
    in the same body (``d[i] = b[i] + s; ...; s = c[i]``) is perfectly well-defined and DaCe compiles it
    correctly; it is excluded only because it chains every statement through ``s``, which makes the loop
    un-fissionable and so exercises none of the granularity the fission arm exists to reach. (It did find
    a real ``LoopFission`` miscompile on the way in -- fixed in DaCe, and pinned there by its own
    regression test, which is where that belongs rather than in this generator.)

    The write/read hazard the arms must handle is still generated -- it just spans two loops, which is
    where fusion has to reason about it anyway.
